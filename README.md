# Assignment 1 : Smith-Waterman
## Discipline : Java
### Description
Algorithm that compares 2 DNA sequences by applying the Smith-Waterman algorithm

### Extra features
* Different colors by number
* Compare your own sequences
* Record your own sequences
* GUI : Graphic User Interface
* Matrix display in terminal
* Restrictive sequence information (A,C,T,G)
* Option unavailable in menu if `DNA_data.txt` file unavailable
* Comparison available if sequences are not the same size
* Small waiting screen during comparison for greater realism
* Remains in menu until exit it
* With the project name, a `clear` is executed on the terminal to always keep the project 
name at the top of the terminal and keep it clean with no command history
* On the left top corner on the GUI, there is 
a small logo (image of DNA) to stay in the theme of the project.
